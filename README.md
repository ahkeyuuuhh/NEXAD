## 📖 Overview

NEXAD is a cross-platform mobile application designed to revolutionize student-teacher consultations in academic institutions. It eliminates the inefficiencies of scattered emails and unprepared meetings by integrating an intelligent booking platform, classroom management hub, and AI-powered document analysis system.

### The Problem
- **Disorganized scheduling:** Back-and-forth emails to book consultations
- **Unprepared meetings:** Teachers review materials during consultations
- **Scattered communication:** Lost attachments and fragmented conversations
- **Lack of insights:** No data on academic needs or support gaps

### The Solution
NEXAD provides:
1. **Intelligent Booking:** AI analyzes requests and suggests relevant documents
2. **AI Smart Briefs:** Teachers receive pre-consultation summaries of student materials
3. **Classroom Hub:** Centralized space for announcements and document collection
4. **Unified Messaging:** Real-time communication within consultation context
5. **Analytics Dashboard:** Insights into academic support patterns
